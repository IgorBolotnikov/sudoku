Hello!

This is my sudoku solving project. Currently the program solves sudoku
using backtracking method.

Upcoming features:
- automatic generation of sudoku puzzles
- possibility to solve sudoku manually
- other algorythms for solving sudoku

PLEASE NOTE: proper work of this code requires Tkinter package. 
It can be installed with the following Terminal/Command Line command:
